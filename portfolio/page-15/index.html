        The Patchworks Framework Quilt translates a design methodology into a physical artifact for the RISD Graduate
        Thesis Show. Constructed from transparent silk, reclaimed jersey, handmade patches, and a printed systems map,
        the quilt visualizes social infrastructure as a layered process, constructed one patch at a time, rather than a
        planned map.

            <p> Sheer silk panels allow underlying systems to remain visible, while reclaimed jersey provides structure
                and weight, grounding the work in reuse and care. Hand-sewn patches mark moments of intervention—small,
                intentional repairs that acknowledge gaps rather than attempting to erase them. The printed map embedded
                within the quilt situates these patches within larger social and infrastructural systems, emphasizing
                context over solutionism.

            Together, these materials form a quilt that can be read both as a textile object and as a framework: a soft,
            evolving model for engaging communities through humility, iteration, and repair.

                These are the design patches, designed to support community organizations in their work. Each one
                addresses a need of community members and is built to help a community organization do their work
                faster, safer, easier... or with a bit more joy.

                This quilted systems map is used to illustrate the place that patches take in the context of larger,
                gappy
                systems. Research and mapping can help the designer and others see the the context of the community orgs
                in
                order to better understand the forces orgs are grappling with.
