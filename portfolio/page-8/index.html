            A 90s Trek ad for aesthetic inspiration, see tan walls, the ostentatiously loud red frame, and the more

            The speedy bag was quite an inspiration for first design, the crossover between trunk and handbag was
            well articulated, and the silhouette of the side panel helped to bridge this gap and inform the later
            design. </p>

            The model cannot be perfect, but creating the 3D form allows me to show the details I would wish to
            communicate to the atelier. <br><Br>
            The bag wears nicely, on or oﬀ the bike, and the classic LV colors can pair with even quite colorful

            I was largely inspired by these taxidermied pieces. I drew inspiration from how they relied on darts and
            organic shapes to reﬂ ect the form of the animal through the material.


            <br><br> Again, I drew inspiration from the speedy bag, this time from the durability and foldable design.

            I knew I wanted to engage with leather. I wanted to create a soft, thin bag with deep black and some sheer.
            I would spec this bag to be made of goat leather for its thin, soft touch, and reminiscence of how leather.

            This is a goatskin leather I would have used, but I determined that this hide was out of my budget for this
            model, and opted for vinyl as a model replacement. <br><br>The soft, responsive draping was a nice material
            to work with, and the thin vinyl used was a near ﬁt, with slightly different textures pressed into the
            material.

            I experimented with screen printing matte on black vinyl, at 2x scale, but ultimately decided that the
            pattern would make too many cuts to the pattern to do the monogram pattern justice. <br><br>
            These samples demonstrate this experimentation. </p>

            The final bag is sleek, supple, and soft. Careful darting reflects the asymmetry of the design, allowing it
            to be useful and tasteful. <br><br> The final bag is perfect for dressing up a work outfit for a small day
