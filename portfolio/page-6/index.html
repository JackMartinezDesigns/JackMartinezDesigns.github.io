        This chest started off as a class project, to perfect and practice a number of hand and machine manufacturing
        techniques learned throughout 2 woodshop courses. My goals were to practice the steam bending process as well as
        work with different woods and techniques. The chest was designed to keep my roommates dog from reaching the
        things on my nightstand when he sneaks into my room, and because of the stark space limitations, a tambour door
        was a natural solution.

            I had to make a number of jigs for this project, from a routing jug for cutting the base and top panels, to
            routing jigs fro cutting slots into the frame. I hand chiseled slots, milled planes and cut the parts to
            size.

            Tambour slats are an age old technique, and surprisingly well documented. Creating the door was a simple
            matter
            of
            meticulously milling hundreds of strips to size then gluing them to a canvas sheet.

            And I had even more ambition to add steam bet legs, which after a few attempts, and thanks to many many
            community hands assistance', turned out fairly consistent, and nearly the exact angle I planned for the
            legs.

            A few layers of finish and some supports went on, and the final peace works well, resting nicely in my room,
            and
            sliding open with ease.

        The project was a lot of fun, and will hopefully serve as a nice piece to start a line on. Steps are in the
        works to try manufacturing a version of this cabinet at larger scale, and I hope to see it in production after
        graduation.
