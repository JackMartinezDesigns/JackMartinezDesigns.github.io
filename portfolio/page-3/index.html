    <p class="description"> What is Gentrification? <br> <br> We once got into an argument in class about whether
        gentrification
        was a good thing or a bad thing, and it wasn't the typical trickle down vs. displacement argument that I'm used
        to, but rather a dispute about what the word even meant. <br><br> To get to a deeper understanding of the issue,
        I decided to lean into my social sciences background, and design tools for research. </p>

        this tool was used to talk about values, and how they relate to how you see gentrification. Some people slid

        We found that place mattered a lot, so to investigate this subject, we decided to build maps. <br> <br> I
        printed simple maps of the various citied my participants were from, then we used simple map pieces made from
        colored vellum, and based on the gerrymandered voting districts
