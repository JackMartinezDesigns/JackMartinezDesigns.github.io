    <p class="description"> This semester I took an interest in social issues. Based on the weak signals of increasing
        attention to empathy, I interrogated the theme of Empathy.
        <br><br>
        â€‹Early mapping and interrogation revealed a few dichotomies, between Empathy and Self-Interest, and Domestic and
        Emotional Labor.

        "Choose Grace" is a speculative futures video intended to draw out an understanding of the tension between
        empathy and self-interest in our contemporary world.
        It deals with concepts of domestic labor, matriarchal roles in the home, and the demands of an equitable
        relationship. I know it is provocative, but please tear it to shreds in the comments, the goal is to start the
        conversation about these themes.

        To bring this conversation into the present discourse, I created an installation on the same theme. In a modern
        gallery with walls filled with self portraits and identity work, this project works to draw out this inner
        tension and ask us to think more critically about the friction inherent in these dominant cultural values.

        A materials exploration revealed a way to demonstrate this issue. The tap-tap-tapping of a student's pencil in
        class helps the tapper to focus, but distracts the rest of the class or office, prioritizing self interest over
        empathy. The artifacts are made out of a resin-cast impressions of pencil tapping display compromising
        roughly-fit solutions to these social issues.

        The annoying drone of the tapping and the motor, echoed through the hall, drawing in curious viewers and ernest
        conversation, as attendees worked to unravel the twines of this tense connection.
