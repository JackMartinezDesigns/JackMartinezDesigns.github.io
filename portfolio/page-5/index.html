        Naloxone was approved by the FDA in 1971 as an opiod antagonist, capable of countering the effects of opioid
        overdoses. Since then, addiction and abuse of opioids in the US has only grown, in the US. as deaths rose in
        Rhode Island, COBRE, a research group out of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital, built, among many
        projects, a community design workshop to ask Product Design to help them solve a small part of this problem.

        People who use drugs, community advocates and harm reduction specialists partneres with researchers and
        designers to see through an iterative design process to manufacture prototypes to be later evaluated and
        produced.

    <p class="description"> This is the clunky box that Naloxone is distributed in is often refused. People who use
        drugs and do carry naloxone often immediately unpackage it, or store it in a car or house. The problem becomes
        that one cannot use naloxone on themselves, so a box in a car can't save a user's life. <br> <br> So the
        challenge was, to make a container that would help uses carry the drug with them on a daily basis.

        Creating a container that can go on your keys, your backpack, or comfortably in a pocket. The product had to be
        water resistant, thermally and UV protectant, and reusable, all while still being affordable enough to produce
        and distribute at low or no cost to the community partners.

        Messaging for this project was crucial, what should the container say? Should it be labled with the more common
        brand name [NARCAN] or the less political drug name [naloxone]? Should the box be concealed in case users feel
        shame to carry it? Should the contents be obvious in case the person who carries the drug overdoses around
        strangers?
        <br><br>
        So, for the final solution, we created a number of sticker options, both to personalize the containers and make
        them more appealing, and so carriers coul customize the messaging to better fit thrir own use case.
