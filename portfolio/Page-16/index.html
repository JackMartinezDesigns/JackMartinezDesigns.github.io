        <br>Design research is the foundation of my industrial design practice, guiding how I understand systems,
        stakeholders, and real-world constraints before proposing form. Through embedded observation, collaboration, and
        iterative testing, research ensures my design decisions are ethical, context-responsive, and built to last.

            <br><br>
            American diets are leaning more and more towards highly processed, carb-based foods. This research project
            investigates how the grocery store plays towards unhealthy eating, and designs a better grocery store for
            healthy eating.

            <br><br>
            This project began as a way to understand what people thought of the term gentrification, beyond positive or
            negative, using maps and map-making kit users described what they understood of gentrification in their own
            city.

            <br><br>
            Patchworks uses applied, community-embedded design research grounded in long-term partnerships with
            healthcare, harm reduction, housing, and food-access organizations. Through participatory observation,
            co-design, prototyping, and ethical reflection, the research generates repeatable tools that translate lived
            experience into durable, context-specific design interventions.

            What began as a design trends project turned into a display on the need for projects that help users develop
            empathy, asking how we can literally step into each others' shoes.
