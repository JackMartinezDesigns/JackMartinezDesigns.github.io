    <p class="description">“Design for social good” is an idea that sells itself. It involves taking the valuable
        insights of the design
        field, which have contributed to building up the wealth of brands like Apple and Nike, and trying to apply these
        skills to support the communities we live in. <br><br>
        But this field also has a shaky history, filled with well-intentioned, but ill-prepared designers venturing into
        communities where they don’t belong and are spending millions of the world’s resources on transporting
        ‘solutions’ from one nation to another. Ideas that often fail to scale or meet the needs of these communities at
        significant social and infrastructural costs.<br><br>
        Determined that this can’t be the only way for design to interact with the field of social work, I dedicated my
        thesis to researching and understanding how design can do better in service to communities. <br><br>
        In a year-long attempt to thoughtfully engage with the design for social good field, I conducted a series of
        case studies. These case studies partnered with community organizations to identify opportunities for design and
        use design to improve processes, offer new ideas, or introduce a little bit more fun into the work that these
        organizations are already doing to support their communities. <br><br>
        As a result of these case studies, I was able to build the patchworks framework, a community-driven design
        process grounded in care, humility, and iteration. This page will walk you through the framework while alluding
        to the case studies and partnerships that yielded these insights. I hope that this framework serves as a jumping
        off point for designers to incorporate design for their communities alongside their practice.<br><br>

            <p>
                Designers begin by reaching out and showing up. The first step in the Patchworks research process is
                volunteering, listening, and asking questions to understand how support systems already operate.
                Building
                partnerships with community partners is key.

            <h2>Understanding Systems</h2>
            <p>

                This quilted systems map is used to illustrate the place that patches take in the context of larger,
                gappy
                systems. Research and mapping can help the designer and others see the the context of the community orgs
                in
                order to better understand the forces orgs are grappling with.

            <h2>Identifying Opportunities</h2>
            <p>

                The process meanders rather than follows a linear model. Insights surface slowly, and designers need to
                meet
                the community partners with tools, games, and interviews to identify potential design opportunities.

            <h2>Prototyping Lightly</h2>
            <p>
                Most ideas never leave paper. The ones that do are sketched, Photoshopped, or mocked up in cardboard.
                Low-fidelity designs and prototypes are used to elicit insights from partners and involve them in early
                decision-making processes.

                Because there may only be one shot at implementation, every detail is carefully worked out. The first
                prototype is often the final, so they need to both work and look for dignified community service.

            Designed tools are documented and delivered with care to community partners. Use of visual guides, and
            implementation training helps make sure that the designs work themselves into the regular infrastructures of
            the partner organizations, rather than being dumped. The goal is fot the projects to remain sustainable
            without depending on oversight or additional labor.
